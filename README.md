This project contains a AI trading bot that trades cryptocurrency by using a combination of market indicators (such as MACD, SMA, Alligator, RSI, CCI, VWAP, Supertrend, etc.) to maximize returns, while minimizing maximum drawdown. To ensure the models work for a range of crypto this project backtests on two large value coins (BTC,ETH), two mid-sized coins (AVAX,BAT) and two small tokens (LINK, MATIC). The method is also tested on different time intervals (15m, 1hr, 4hr, and 1d).

This bot trades cryptocurrencies using pine strategies in Tradingview. The pine strategies are optimized using machine learning techniques generated in a Jupyter Lab notebook using the XGBoost Algorithm and Linear Regression.
